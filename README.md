## Challange #1
Band Name Generator 

## Overview

Hello! My name is Mert, and this is the first project in my "100 Days of Python" challenge. The Band Name Generator is a simple Python program that creatively generates a band name based on the user's input.

## How it Works

This Python script asks the user two questions:
1. The name of the city they grew up in.
2. Their pet's name.

Using this information, the script combines the answers to generate a unique and fun band name.
When you run this script, it will prompt you to enter the name of the city you grew up in and the name of your pet. After entering this information, it will output a suggested band name combining these two answers.

Feel free to try it out and see what interesting band names you can come up with!
